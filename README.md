## Overview
The `GovernorBravo` contract suite is part of a decentralized governance system, supporting proposals, voting, and administrative updates. It is designed with modular storage for upgradeability and future expansion, using event-driven tracking for proposal actions and a timelock for proposal execution. The contract also includes a whitelisting mechanism for privileged account access.

## Features
- **Proposal Management**: Create, vote, cancel, queue, and execute governance proposals.
- **Voting Power Snapshot**: Utilize historical voting power from governance token holders.
- **Timelock Execution**: Enforce delays on proposal execution to ensure decentralized control and allow community input before enactment.
- **Modular Storage Architecture**: Organized across multiple storage contracts (`V1` and `V2`) for versioned upgradeability.
- **Whitelist Management**: Control privileged accounts through expiration and guardian role.

## Contracts Structure

1. **GovernorBravoEvents**: Defines all events emitted during governance activities.
2. **GovernorBravoDelegatorStorage**: Contains base storage variables and access control (`admin`, `pendingAdmin`).
3. **GovernorBravoDelegateStorageV1**: Stores parameters for proposal and voting configuration (`votingDelay`, `votingPeriod`, `proposalThreshold`).
4. **GovernorBravoDelegateStorageV2**: Adds whitelisting capabilities, allowing specified accounts to perform actions under the guardianâ€™s management.
5. **Interfaces**:
   - **TimelockInterface**: Queue, execute, and cancel time-delayed proposals.
   - **CompInterface**: Retrieve historical voting power snapshots for proposals.

## Key Functional Components

### Proposal Lifecycle
Each proposal has a unique `Proposal` struct to track its:
- `proposer` and `targets`
- Voting period (start and end blocks)
- Execution timestamp (if successful)
- Vote tallies (`forVotes`, `againstVotes`, `abstainVotes`)
- Status indicators (canceled or executed)

### Voting and Thresholds
The contract enforces minimum thresholds and delay periods:
- **Voting Delay**: Number of blocks before voting starts post-proposal.
- **Voting Period**: Duration in blocks for which voting is open.
- **Proposal Threshold**: Minimum number of votes required to propose.

### Timelock Functionality
The `TimelockInterface` enforces delays on proposal execution:
- **Queue and Execute Transactions**: Proposal actions are delayed to allow governance review.
- **Grace Period**: Defines the window during which queued proposals can be executed.

### Whitelisting (V2)
The `GovernorBravoDelegateStorageV2` contract introduces:
- **Whitelist Expirations**: Accounts can have timed access based on `whitelistAccountExpirations`.
- **Whitelist Guardian**: A dedicated role to manage whitelist privileges and propose whitelisted actions.

## Events
- **Proposal Management Events**: `ProposalCreated`, `ProposalCanceled`, `ProposalQueued`, and `ProposalExecuted`.
- **Voting Events**: `VoteCast` (captures voter, proposal ID, support type, votes, and optional reason).
- **Parameter Update Events**: `VotingDelaySet`, `VotingPeriodSet`, `ProposalThresholdSet`, and `NewImplementation`.
- **Admin and Whitelist Updates**: `NewAdmin`, `WhitelistGuardianSet`, `WhitelistAccountExpirationSet`.

## Security Considerations
- **Access Control**: `admin` and `whitelistGuardian` are crucial roles for secure contract operation.
- **Upgrade Safety**: Proper storage management is essential, as updates across `V1` and `V2` should avoid storage collisions.
- **Reentrancy and Overflow Checks**: Ensuring safe and secure transitions between proposal states and verifying timelock operations.

## License
The `GovernorBravo` contracts are licensed under the BSD-3-Clause license.

## Deployment and Testing
1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure Solidity and a compatible Ethereum development environment.
2. **Compile**: Run the compiler to validate contract syntax and bytecode generation.
3. **Deploy**: Deploy the contract suite, starting with any dependency contracts (e.g., `Timelock`, `Comp`).
4. **Run Tests**: Unit tests should validate proposal lifecycle, voting, and timelock delays.
