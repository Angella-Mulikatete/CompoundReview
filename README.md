### 1.5 Compound Governance
Compound Protocol is a decentralized money market protocol with algorithmic interest rates based on supply-demand dynamics, allowing for seamless Ethereum-based asset transfers.  

Compound Governance is the decentralized decision-making system for managing Compound Finance, a DeFi protocol on the Ethereum blockchain that provides lending and borrowing services. Key elements of Compound Governance include:  

- **COMP Token:** The protocol’s governance token, where token holders’ voting power corresponds to their COMP holdings.  
- **Proposal Creation:** COMP holders can propose protocol changes, ranging from adjustments to new feature introductions.  
- **Voting and Approval:** Token holders vote “for,” “against,” or “abstain.” A proposal requires a quorum and a certain threshold of “for” votes to be approved.  
- **Execution:** Approved proposals proceed to implementation, enabling community-driven decisions.  

Compound Governance fosters community-driven decision-making, promoting a secure, inclusive, and decentralized protocol evolution.

### 1.6 GovernorBravoDelegate  
The GovernorBravoDelegate contract is integral to Compound’s governance, enabling token holders to create proposals and vote on protocol changes, such as asset listings and rate adjustments. The contract defines constants and functions regulating governance parameters, including voting period lengths, quorum requirements, and proposal thresholds. Its critical role underpins Compound’s decentralized and community-managed protocol structure.  

### 1.7 Scope  
This audit evaluates the **GovernorBravoDelegateStorageV1** and **GovernorBravoDelegateStorageV2** smart contracts, alongside related storage and event definitions. The audit focuses on identifying security issues, optimizing code, and ensuring alignment with Compound’s governance specifications.


## Overview
The `GovernorBravo` contract suite is part of a decentralized governance system, supporting proposals, voting, and administrative updates. It is designed with modular storage for upgradeability and future expansion, using event-driven tracking for proposal actions and a timelock for proposal execution. The contract also includes a whitelisting mechanism for privileged account access.

## Features
- **Proposal Management**: Create, vote, cancel, queue, and execute governance proposals.
- **Voting Power Snapshot**: Utilize historical voting power from governance token holders.
- **Timelock Execution**: Enforce delays on proposal execution to ensure decentralized control and allow community input before enactment.
- **Modular Storage Architecture**: Organized across multiple storage contracts (`V1` and `V2`) for versioned upgradeability.
- **Whitelist Management**: Control privileged accounts through expiration and guardian role.

## Contracts Structure

1. **GovernorBravoEvents**: Defines all events emitted during governance activities.
2. **GovernorBravoDelegatorStorage**: Contains base storage variables and access control (`admin`, `pendingAdmin`).
3. **GovernorBravoDelegateStorageV1**: Stores parameters for proposal and voting configuration (`votingDelay`, `votingPeriod`, `proposalThreshold`).
4. **GovernorBravoDelegateStorageV2**: Adds whitelisting capabilities, allowing specified accounts to perform actions under the guardian’s management.
5. **Interfaces**:
   - **TimelockInterface**: Queue, execute, and cancel time-delayed proposals.
   - **CompInterface**: Retrieve historical voting power snapshots for proposals.

## Key Functional Components

### Proposal Lifecycle
Each proposal has a unique `Proposal` struct to track its:
- `proposer` and `targets`
- Voting period (start and end blocks)
- Execution timestamp (if successful)
- Vote tallies (`forVotes`, `againstVotes`, `abstainVotes`)
- Status indicators (canceled or executed)

### Voting and Thresholds
The contract enforces minimum thresholds and delay periods:
- **Voting Delay**: Number of blocks before voting starts post-proposal.
- **Voting Period**: Duration in blocks for which voting is open.
- **Proposal Threshold**: Minimum number of votes required to propose.

### Timelock Functionality
The `TimelockInterface` enforces delays on proposal execution:
- **Queue and Execute Transactions**: Proposal actions are delayed to allow governance review.
- **Grace Period**: Defines the window during which queued proposals can be executed.

### Whitelisting (V2)
The `GovernorBravoDelegateStorageV2` contract introduces:
- **Whitelist Expirations**: Accounts can have timed access based on `whitelistAccountExpirations`.
- **Whitelist Guardian**: A dedicated role to manage whitelist privileges and propose whitelisted actions.

## Events
- **Proposal Management Events**: `ProposalCreated`, `ProposalCanceled`, `ProposalQueued`, and `ProposalExecuted`.
- **Voting Events**: `VoteCast` (captures voter, proposal ID, support type, votes, and optional reason).
- **Parameter Update Events**: `VotingDelaySet`, `VotingPeriodSet`, `ProposalThresholdSet`, and `NewImplementation`.
- **Admin and Whitelist Updates**: `NewAdmin`, `WhitelistGuardianSet`, `WhitelistAccountExpirationSet`.

## Security Considerations
- **Access Control**: `admin` and `whitelistGuardian` are crucial roles for secure contract operation.
- **Upgrade Safety**: Proper storage management is essential, as updates across `V1` and `V2` should avoid storage collisions.
- **Reentrancy and Overflow Checks**: Ensuring safe and secure transitions between proposal states and verifying timelock operations.

## License
The `GovernorBravo` contracts are licensed under the BSD-3-Clause license.

## Deployment and Testing
1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure Solidity and a compatible Ethereum development environment.
2. **Compile**: Run the compiler to validate contract syntax and bytecode generation.
3. **Deploy**: Deploy the contract suite, starting with any dependency contracts (e.g., `Timelock`, `Comp`).
4. **Run Tests**: Unit tests should validate proposal lifecycle, voting, and timelock delays.
