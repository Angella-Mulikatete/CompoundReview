### 1.4 Compound Protocol
The Compound Protocol is a decentralized finance (DeFi) application that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies in a trustless manner. It operates on the Ethereum blockchain and is known for its algorithmic interest rate model that adjusts based on supply and demand

####  Components of the Compound Protocol

1. **Lending and Borrowing**: DUsers can supply assets to the Compound protocol to earn interest or borrow assets by providing collateral. The protocol calculates interest rates algorithmically based on the current utilization of the assets.
2. **cTokens**: When users supply assets to Compound, they receive cTokens in return. These tokens represent the user's share in the Compound pool and accrue interest over time. For example, if a user supplies DAI, they receive cDAI, which can be redeemed for the underlying DAI plus interest.
3. **Interest Rates**:  Interest rates in Compound are dynamic and vary based on the supply and demand of each asset. Users can see current interest rates for lending and borrowing on the platform.
4. **Collateralization**:To borrow assets, users must provide collateral. The collateral must exceed the value of the borrowed assets to ensure the protocol's solvency. If the value of the collateral falls below a certain threshold, it can be liquidated to cover the loan.
5. **Governance**: Compound is governed by its community of token holders who hold COMP tokens. These tokens grant governance rights, allowing holders to propose changes to the protocol, vote on proposals, and influence future developments.
   
### 1.5 Compound Governance
Compound Governance refers to the decentralized governance system employed by Compound Finance, a prominent decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol. Compound Finance is built on the Ethereum blockchain and provides lending and borrowing services for various cryptocurrencies.

The governance mechanism allows token holders to participate in the decision-making process regarding the protocol's development, changes, and upgrades. The native token of Compound, COMP, plays a central role in this governance system.

####  Components of the Compound Governance

1. **COMP Token**: The COMP token is the native governance token of the Compound Protocol. Users can earn COMP tokens by supplying or borrowing assets on the platform. COMP holders can participate in governance by voting on proposals or creating new proposals.
2. **Governance Proposals**: Any user with COMP tokens can submit governance proposals. These proposals can include changes to the protocol parameters, such as interest rates, collateral factors, or the addition of new assets.
3. **Voting Mechanism**:  Proposals are voted on by COMP holders. Each token represents one vote, and proposals require a majority of votes to pass. Voting takes place over a defined period, typically one week.
4. **Timelock**:Once a proposal is passed, it goes into a timelock period before implementation. This provides an opportunity for users to respond to the proposal before it is enacted.

### 1.6 GovernorBravoDelegate  
GovernorBravoDelegate contract is an implementation of the governance mechanism used in Compound. It is a contract that handles the logic for proposing and voting on changes to the protocol

####  Components of the Compound Governance

1. **Proposal Creation**: Users can create proposals that specify actions to be taken, including calling specific functions on other contracts with parameters defined in the proposal.
2. **Voting Process**: The contract manages the voting process, allowing users to cast their votes for or against proposals during a specified voting period.
3. **Proposal States**: Proposals can have various states, including Pending, Active, Canceled, Succeeded, Queued, Expired, and Executed. The state of a proposal dictates what actions can be taken at any given time.
4. **Vote Recording**:The contract records votes and maintains receipts that track which addresses voted and how they voted.
5. **Implementation Upgrades**: The `GovernorBravoDelegate` also allows for upgrades to the governance logic itself by enabling a new implementation address to be set, which is important for evolving the governance mechanisms.
6. **Whitelist Management**: The contract may incorporate features for managing a whitelist of accounts that can participate in certain governance activities.
7. **Vote Recording:**:The `GovernorBravoEvents` contract emits events during key actions, such as proposal creation, voting, and changes to governance parameters, which helps in tracking the protocol's governance activities on-chain.

### 1.7 Contracts Structure

1. **GovernorBravoEvents**: Defines all events emitted during governance activities.
2. **GovernorBravoDelegatorStorage**: Contains base storage variables and access control (`admin`, `pendingAdmin`).
3. **GovernorBravoDelegateStorageV1**: Stores parameters for proposal and voting configuration (`votingDelay`, `votingPeriod`, `proposalThreshold`).
4. **GovernorBravoDelegateStorageV2**: Adds whitelisting capabilities, allowing specified accounts to perform actions under the guardianâ€™s management.
5. **Interfaces**:
   - **TimelockInterface**: This interface defines the functions that can be called on the Timelock contract. The delay function returns the delay period specified in the Timelock contract. The GRACE_PERIOD function returns the grace period specified in the Timelock contract. The acceptAdmin function is used to accept the admin role for the Timelock contract. The queuedTransactions function is used to check whether a transaction with the specified hash has been queued in the Timelock contract. The queueTransaction function is used to add a transaction to the queue in the Timelock contract. The cancelTransaction function is used to cancel a transaction that has been queued in the Timelock contract. The executeTransaction function is used to execute a transaction that has been queued in the Timelock contract.
   - **CompInterface**:This interface defines the functions that can be called on the COMP token contract. The getPriorVotes function is used to get the number of votes that an account had at a specific block number. This function is used in the governance system of the Compound protocol to determine the voting power of token holders.
   - **GovernorAlpha**:This interface defines the function that can be called on the GovernorAlpha contract. The proposalCount function returns the total number of proposals (state variable) that have been created in the governance system of the Compound protocol. This function is used to keep track of the number of proposals.
