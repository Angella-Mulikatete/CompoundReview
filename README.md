### 1.5 Compound Protocol
The Compound Protocol is a decentralized finance (DeFi) application that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies in a trustless manner. It operates on the Ethereum blockchain and is known for its algorithmic interest rate model that adjusts based on supply and demand

##  Components of the Compound Protocol

1. **Lending and Borrowing**: DUsers can supply assets to the Compound protocol to earn interest or borrow assets by providing collateral. The protocol calculates interest rates algorithmically based on the current utilization of the assets.
2. **cTokens**: When users supply assets to Compound, they receive cTokens in return. These tokens represent the user's share in the Compound pool and accrue interest over time. For example, if a user supplies DAI, they receive cDAI, which can be redeemed for the underlying DAI plus interest.
3. **Interest Rates**:  Interest rates in Compound are dynamic and vary based on the supply and demand of each asset. Users can see current interest rates for lending and borrowing on the platform.
4. **Collateralization**:To borrow assets, users must provide collateral. The collateral must exceed the value of the borrowed assets to ensure the protocol's solvency. If the value of the collateral falls below a certain threshold, it can be liquidated to cover the loan.
5. **Governance**: Compound is governed by its community of token holders who hold COMP tokens. These tokens grant governance rights, allowing holders to propose changes to the protocol, vote on proposals, and influence future developments.
   
### 1.6 Compound Governance
Compound Governance refers to the decentralized governance system employed by Compound Finance, a prominent decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol. Compound Finance is built on the Ethereum blockchain and provides lending and borrowing services for various cryptocurrencies.

The governance mechanism allows token holders to participate in the decision-making process regarding the protocol's development, changes, and upgrades. The native token of Compound, COMP, plays a central role in this governance system.
##  Components of the Compound Governance

1. **COMP Token**: The COMP token is the native governance token of the Compound Protocol. Users can earn COMP tokens by supplying or borrowing assets on the platform. COMP holders can participate in governance by voting on proposals or creating new proposals.
2. **Governance Proposals**: Any user with COMP tokens can submit governance proposals. These proposals can include changes to the protocol parameters, such as interest rates, collateral factors, or the addition of new assets.
3. **Voting Mechanism**:  Proposals are voted on by COMP holders. Each token represents one vote, and proposals require a majority of votes to pass. Voting takes place over a defined period, typically one week.
4. **Timelock**:Once a proposal is passed, it goes into a timelock period before implementation. This provides an opportunity for users to respond to the proposal before it is enacted.

### 1.7 GovernorBravoDelegate  
The GovernorBravoDelegate contract is integral to Compound’s governance, enabling token holders to create proposals and vote on protocol changes, such as asset listings and rate adjustments. The contract defines constants and functions regulating governance parameters, including voting period lengths, quorum requirements, and proposal thresholds. Its critical role underpins Compound’s decentralized and community-managed protocol structure.  

### 1.8 Contract Overview
The `GovernorBravo` contract suite is part of a decentralized governance system, supporting proposals, voting, and administrative updates. It is designed with modular storage for upgradeability and future expansion, using event-driven tracking for proposal actions and a timelock for proposal execution. The contract also includes a whitelisting mechanism for privileged account access.

## Features
- **Proposal Management**: Create, vote, cancel, queue, and execute governance proposals.
- **Voting Power Snapshot**: Utilize historical voting power from governance token holders.
- **Timelock Execution**: Enforce delays on proposal execution to ensure decentralized control and allow community input before enactment.
- **Modular Storage Architecture**: Organized across multiple storage contracts (`V1` and `V2`) for versioned upgradeability.
- **Whitelist Management**: Control privileged accounts through expiration and guardian role.

## Contracts Structure

1. **GovernorBravoEvents**: Defines all events emitted during governance activities.
2. **GovernorBravoDelegatorStorage**: Contains base storage variables and access control (`admin`, `pendingAdmin`).
3. **GovernorBravoDelegateStorageV1**: Stores parameters for proposal and voting configuration (`votingDelay`, `votingPeriod`, `proposalThreshold`).
4. **GovernorBravoDelegateStorageV2**: Adds whitelisting capabilities, allowing specified accounts to perform actions under the guardian’s management.
5. **Interfaces**:
   - **TimelockInterface**: This interface defines the functions that can be called on the Timelock contract. The delay function returns the delay period specified in the Timelock contract. The GRACE_PERIOD function returns the grace period specified in the Timelock contract. The acceptAdmin function is used to accept the admin role for the Timelock contract. The queuedTransactions function is used to check whether a transaction with the specified hash has been queued in the Timelock contract. The queueTransaction function is used to add a transaction to the queue in the Timelock contract. The cancelTransaction function is used to cancel a transaction that has been queued in the Timelock contract. The executeTransaction function is used to execute a transaction that has been queued in the Timelock contract.
   - **CompInterface**:This interface defines the functions that can be called on the COMP token contract. The getPriorVotes function is used to get the number of votes that an account had at a specific block number. This function is used in the governance system of the Compound protocol to determine the voting power of token holders.
   - **GovernorAlpha**:This interface defines the function that can be called on the GovernorAlpha contract. The proposalCount function returns the total number of proposals (state variable) that have been created in the governance system of the Compound protocol. This function is used to keep track of the number of proposals.
